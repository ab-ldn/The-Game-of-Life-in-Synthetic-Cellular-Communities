# The-Game-of-Life-in-Synthetic-Cellular-Communities
The aim of this project is to build a cellular automaton to simulate cells engineered with a GRN that confers mushroom bifurcation behaviour in order to investigate if they are indeed Turing-complete. Cellular automata were the chosen method of modelling so that the spatial activity of the simulated synthetically-modified cells can be compared with that exhibited by cells in the Game of Life, which would indicate whether the engineered cells can be used to perform computations, in addition to helping understand how to build and improve the design of the GRN. In order for the results to be of sufficient quality to draw feasible conclusions, the model must simulate the cells and their environment as realistically possible. There were several stages of the project, each adding additional parameters and layers of refinement after evaluation. It is important to note that this work is proprietary and in very early stages.
